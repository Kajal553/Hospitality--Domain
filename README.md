# Project Announcement: Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Industry

### Problem Statement

Atliq Grands, a prominent player in the hospitality sector with a two-decade legacy, owns a network of five-star hotels across India. Facing challenges from strategic moves by competitors and suboptimal decision-making in management, Atliq Grands has witnessed a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotels segment. In a strategic initiative to reverse this trend, the managing director aims to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" to reclaim market share and revenue. However, lacking an in-house data analytics team, Atliq Grands has decided to enlist the services of a third-party provider to extract insights from their historical data.

**Task List:**

As a data analyst, your responsibility involves working on the given task, utilizing sample data and a mock-up dashboard provided. Relevant documents for download are available in the designated section.

1. Formulate metrics based on the provided metric list.
2. Develop a dashboard in alignment with the stakeholders' mock-up.
3. Generate insightful findings beyond those specified in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.


## Insights Visualized:
Utilizing Power BI, I have developed a live dashboard that provides key insights into crucial aspects of the Hospitality Domain:

1. RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): A critical metric for understanding revenue generation.
2. ADR (Average Daily Rate): Analysing the average rate paid for rooms sold.
3.	DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Tracking daily room bookings.
4.	DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): The number of rooms available for sale each day.
5.	DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Insights into the number of rooms utilized by customers daily.

## Lessons Learned from this Project
1) This project has been an incredible learning experience, offering insights into the specific challenges and nuances of the hospitality domain. 
Each industry presents its own unique data landscape to navigate.

2) Examined various cancellation policies implemented by different hotels, revealing that a majority charge zero fees only for cancellations made three months prior to the booking date. Subsequent cancellations incur charges ranging from 60% to 90% of the booking cost.

### Key Insights from the Dashboard
1. Mumbai leads in revenue generation (669 M), followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.
2. AtliQ Exotica outperforms all seven property types with 320 million in revenue, a rating of 3.62, a 57% occupancy rate, and a 24.4% cancellation rate.
3. AtliQ Bay boasts the highest occupancy at 66%.
4. Week 24 recorded the highest revenue at 139.6 million.
5. Delhi ranks highest in both occupancy and rating, followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore.
6. AtliQ incurred a loss of approximately 298 million due to cancellations.
7. Elite-type rooms have the highest number of bookings but also a higher cancellation rate.
